Task            |           Library/Program to use
==================================================
DNS resolver                    just need c/c++ standard library
(turn domain into ip)

HTTP requester                  libcurl
(ask ip for raw html text)

Basic GUI setup                 GUI manager library
(draw window where page         like qt5, gtk3, tkinter, etc.
    will be displayed)

HTML Parser                     Probably have to write one,
(turn html string into          I think this part is where the
    pretty picture)             meat is...

Display parsed webpage          GUI manager /  HTML parser 
(put things on gui window
    wherever html parser
    says to put them)

Hyperlinks                      GUI manager
(probably easy to do,
    just update page
    when link is clicked)

Images/Videos/iFrames           GUI manager
(I assume our parser will have
    started by just displaying
    text)


------------------------------------------------------
ADVANCED STUFF
------------------------------------------------------

Resizable GUI window
(i think it will be MUCH easier
    to write a parser if we assume some
    fixed pixel width/height, but obviously
    that would be a pretty SHITE browser)

HTTP POST request
(send data back to
    web server)

Javascript
(this one prolly not gonna happen lol)
